Unlike those who came before him, he wasn't the lovable but dim-witted guy with a heart of gold. He was smart, calculating, arrogant, and shrimp-sized. But most daring of all was the fact that Edward is technically disabled, having had both an arm and a leg lost in a tragic accident fueled by love and hubris.",

Raised in the forest by his aunt, Gon is closely attuned to nature and animals, making him a skilled hunter. But despite these skills, he's still just a kid who can be impatient, impetuous, and ill-tempered. ",

She's also a very capable detective, often going solo to root out the truth behind the cases she's working. And she does it all while surrounded by a male-centric supporting cast.
